I like to think my fly-on-the-wall perspective is sometimes funny and mostly fair.\n\nRemember though that this is Bollywood; aka tinsel town, the land of Prada & Paparazzi. Here everyone wants to be on \u201cPage 3\u2033 \u2013 a direct descendant of the LA \u201cPage 6\u201d and very often they\u2019ll stop at nothing for a full color high resolution mugshot.
