Follow us on www.twitter.com\/PeterEngland_","can_post":false,"category":"Company","checkins":0,"company_overview":"Peter England is the largest menswear brand in India with nearly 5 million garments sold every year. First launched by Madura Fashion and Lifestyle (then known as Madura Garments) in the mid-price shirt segment in 1997, the company acquired the world rights for the brand in the year 2000.\n\nDuring that time, a new India was emerging, a land of growth and opportunity. The apparel consumption behaviour was undergoing a sea change, and there was a huge market opportunity waiting to be explored. Consumers were exposed to branded formal menswear, but there were no dominant national players in the mid-priced segment. \n\nMadura Garments recognised the huge opportunity that was theirs for the taking. With 4.5 million urban men who were in the market for shirts with international finish and quality, it was imperative that they find an international brand with a reputation for excellent quality and modern style at value for money prices. The search ended with Peter England that had, in the century since its inception, forged a name both for product excellence and for down-to-earth prices, reflecting in its tag \u2018The Honest Shirt\u2019. \n\nThe launch of Peter England nationwide through a massive advertising campaign marked the entrance of the first international mid-priced shirt in India. It was clearly positioned as an international quality brand at honest to goodness prices. The brand found immediate acceptance with a large segment of the male population who wanted to look good at work without having to pay a heavy price. Peter England sold 400,000 shirts that first year.\n\nToday, Peter England has a strong national presence with 400 exclusive stores and over 1600 multi-brand outlets in more than 570 towns. \n\nPeter England is universally accepted amongst its millions of consumers for its standardised fits, superior quality, wide range and 'fashion-right' styles, making it the most trusted brand amongst consumers in the readymade apparel category, as per a studies conducted by Brand Equity, Economic Times over the last three years. \n\nWith offerings in the mid-priced value for money range, Peter England brings formal wear for young men in the early years of their career. The product assortment includes shirts, trousers, suits, blazers and accessories for 'Everyday' and 'Special' occasions. \n\nIt also offers 'Relaxed Office wear' and 'Weekend Casual wear' through its Peter England Elements line. This is an eclectic and stylish casual wardrobe including washed cotton shirts, denims, cargoes, jackets, sweaters and accessories. \n\nPeter England also offers a complete range of sub-premium formals through its sub-brand Peter England Elite, meant for the young manager. The wardrobe includes a complete array of fine-crafted formal shirts and trousers, sharp suits and blazers, and accessories. The look is progressive, international, and one of understated elegance. \n\nPeter England partners with the IPL team, Chennai Super Kings, as the official \u2018Off the Field\u2019 apparel sponsor. Building on that relationship, the brand has launched an exclusive product line called PE-CSK, which reflects the sporty-casual attitude of the team. \n\nA recent foray for Peter England has been in the world of clubwear, called Peter England Party. This line offers affordable club wear with mainstream sensibilities.\n","cover":{"cover_id":818128424891590,"offset_x":0,"offset_y":0,"source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xaf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/10408171_818128424891590_4685489701430490944_n.jpg?oh=5cf6efd2e799db76f68bb3aa36e1b8ee&oe=55BADEC3","id":"818128424891590"},"founded":"1889","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":1600624,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/peterenglandofficial","name":"Peter England","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"talking_about_count":16382,"username":"peterenglandofficial","website":"www.peterengland.com","were_here_count":0}
