It was founded on 26 December 1997; with deep rooted belief in secularism and value-based politics, and exemplary commitment to the development of Odisha and its people. Much of the popularity and electoral success of the party is credited to Sri Naveen Patnaik's image as an incorruptible and 'clean' leader.\n\n\nA true leader of the masses and the champion of the cause of Odias, late Sri Biju Patnaik, fondly remembered as Biju Babu by its people, is the guiding light for the BJD. His entire life was dedicated to safeguarding the political and cultural foundations of Odisha, and improving the socio-economic lot of its people. Biju Babu\u2019s integrity, vision and selfless dedication to the cause of Odisha and its people have greatly influenced the leaders, youth and workers in the party.\n\n \nThough, the BJD has participated in several ruling coalitions with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) both at the Centre and in Odisha, it, however, was one of the main professedly secular parties of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). BJD has a staunch secular and democratic outlook, and it has always taken a firm and unequivocal stand against communal forces.\n\n\nThe Party believes in continuously working towards the upliftment of weaker sections of society and fighting against social injustice. The party has always stood for, supported and advocated in favour of women, youths, farmers, labourers, workers\u2019 unions (Labour unions), religious minorities, and the weaker\/backward sections of the society. It is committed to ensure provisions of food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices.\n","founded":"Sri Naveen Patnaik","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":33284,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BijuJanataDal","location":{"city":"Bhubaneswar","country":"India","street":"BJD Headquaters, 6R\/3, Unit-6, Forest park","zip":"751001"},"mission":"Biju Janata Dal is inspired to make the dream of legendary Biju Babu a reality; which aims at building an Odisha that lifts all Odias.
