The Samajwadi Party believes in continuously working towards the upliftment of weaker sections of society and it stands against communal forces.\n\nFreedom fighter, socialist and a great Parliamentarian, Ram Manohar Lohia is a guiding light for the Samajwadi Party. Ram Manohar Lohia\u2019s integrity, selfless struggle for India\u2019s independence and his ability to unite people of all sections of society has greatly influenced the leaders, youth and workers in the party. Lohia was jailed by the British several times during the freedom struggle and he fought rigorously all his life for social equality.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\u2019s ideas greatly influenced Lohia who worked tirelessly during the freedom movement writing articles against the British, raising awareness against British imperialism in Europe, and after India became independent devoted himself to grassroots politics which included farmers cause, development work and fighting against social injustice. He also worked towards putting an end to capitalist-feudalistic tendencies.\n\nLohia\u2019s ability to awaken the people with his fiery articles on Satyagraha and his innate knowledge of social problems made him the foremost socialist leader of India. Lohia\u2019s \u2018Do or Die\u2019 spirit is an inspiration and a guiding force for the Samajwadi Party in its struggle for social upliftment of the poor, backward and socially weaker sections of society.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":267221,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/samajwadiparty","location":{"city":"Lucknow","country":"India","street":"19, Vikramaditya Marg","zip":"226001"},"name":"Samajwadi Party","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"phone":"0522-2236868","talking_about_count":45053,"username":"samajwadiparty","website":"http:\/\/www.samajwadiparty.in","were_here_count":0}
