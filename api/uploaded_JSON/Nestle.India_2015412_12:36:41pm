We are a vibrant Company that provides consumers in India with products of global standards and we're committed to long-term sustainable growth and shareholder satisfaction. Our ambition is to be the world\u2019s leading Nutrition, Health and Wellness Company.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has been a partner in India's growth for nearly a century now and has built a very special relationship of trust and commitment with the people of India. The Company's activities in India have facilitated direct and indirect employment and provides livelihood to about one million people including farmers, suppliers of packaging materials, services and other goods.\n\nAs the largest food and beverage manufacturer in the world with many trusted, leading brands such as MAGGI, NESCAFE, KITKAT and MILKMAID, we are committed to leverage our superior R&D capability and nutrition science know-how to consistently develop products that offer a great balance of taste and health. We also endeavor to help our consumers make well-informed, healthy food choices through clear nutrition labeling on the back of every pack in the form of the Nestl\u00e9 Nutritional Compass.  \n\nWe know everyone has different taste and nutrition needs and hence, we localize our global health and nutrition know-how to tackle specific nutritional requirements of Indian consumers. For instance, some of our recent innovations, such as Maggi Masala-e-Magic, a fortified taste enhancer for everyday Indian dishes offers great tasting nutrition at an affordable price point and provides 15% of RDA of Iron, Iodine & Vitamin A (top 3 micronutrients that are deficient in Indian population).\n\nOur products can be enjoyed by our consumers throughout their lives, across various occasions. It is this ability to be a consistent part of our consumers\u2019 food journey that allows Nestl\u00e9 to live and deliver the Good Food, Good Life promise.\n\nVisit us on:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.nestle.in\/ - For information on Nestle India Ltd\n\nhttp:\/\/www.nestle.in\/csv - For information on CSV at Nestle India Ltd\n\nhttp:\/\/www.nestle.in\/nhw - For information on Nutrition, Health and Wellness at Nestle India Ltd.
