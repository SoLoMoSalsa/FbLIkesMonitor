Starting with a single product - a nail enamel unlike any before it - the three founders pooled their meager resources and developed a unique manufacturing process.\n \nRevlon is today a global leader in cosmetics, hair color, fragrances, skincare and beauty care products. One of the strongest consumer brand franchises in the world, Revlon\u2019s products are sold in over 100 countries across six continents.\n \nAs a leading cosmetics brand, Revlon revitalized the industry over the years with iconic nail and lip colors and with breakthrough technology like ColorStay transfer-resistant lipstick and makeup.\n \nRevlon does not conduct animal testing and has not done so since 1989.  We comprehensively test all of our products using the most technologically advanced methods available to ensure they are both innovative and safe to use.  We believe that women should have the opportunity to express themselves through makeup, so we sell our products in many markets around the world and as such, are subject to local rules and regulations.  Regulatory authorities in a few countries conduct independent testing in order to satisfy their own mandatory registration requirements. Revlon complies with all regulations in the countries in which our products are sold, and supports the advancement of non-animal testing alternatives and methodologies in our industry.","name":"Revlon","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"talking_about_count":21970,"username":"revlon","website":"http:\/\/www.revlon.com\/loveison","were_here_count":0}
