He was inspired to take up singing professionally by his first guru Sharomani Kavishar Karnail Singh Paras Ramoowalia.\n\nHis first professional break came in 1992 when the album 'Chithiye Nee Chithiye' became an instant hit with record-breaking sales around the world. This was all happening while HM was still living in Canada. Realizing the fact that the Punjabi music industry is very limited in Canada and in order to further pursue his singing career, he decided to become the first-ever artist to move back to India. HM's melodious voice and unique style was still relatively undiscovered outside of Punjab until 1999 when T-Series released his album 'OYE HOYE', introducing him to a much wider audience  through MTV and other major national music channels. 'OYE HOYE' was an explosive international hit and HM's Punjabi-pop style took a liking to every generation in households across India.\n\nThrough his worldwide singing tours, HM came to a realization that in order to keep the Punjabi language & culture alive, especially in the younger generation world over, Punjabi cinema needs to be revived as it is a very strong medium through which cultural issues & concerns can be brought forth in an entertaining way. Realistically, it is very difficult to get our young children to read Punjabi newspapers or watch the news in Punjabi but much easier for them to watch a Punjabi movie, through which they can learn their mother tongue & culture. He then used his energies, connections & sources to the max and finally in 2002, after a 3 year struggle, managed to convince Manmohan Singh & T-Series to make 'Jee Aayan Nu'. This movie certainly created history in more than one way. It was the first ever Punjabi movie to have a worldwide release, the making, canvas & the presentation was at par with any top-notch Bollywood production.\n\nTill date HM has acted in 7 movies which include:\n\nJee Aayan Nu\nAsa Nu Maan Watna Da\nDil Apna Punjabi\nMitti Wajaan Maardi\nMera Pind-My home\nJag Jeondeyan De Mele\nHeer Ranjha\nYaara o Dildaara\n\n\n\n\n","general_manager":"Gurbinder Sandhu","genre":"Punjabi","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":966906,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/harbhajanmann","location":{"city":"Chandigarh","country":"India","street":"Mohali punjab India"},"name":"Harbhajan Mann","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"personal_interests":"Reading, traveling, watching ice hockey games, keeping active & fit through gym & activities with my childeren, spending quality time with my loving family.","talking_about_count":110248,"username":"harbhajanmann","website":"http:\/\/www.harbhajanmann.com","were_here_count":0}
