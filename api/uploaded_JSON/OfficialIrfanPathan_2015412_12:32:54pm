Irfan's Twitter Account: https:\/\/twitter.com\/IrfanPathan","awards":"ICC Emerging Player of the Year - 2004\nMan of the Match - ICC T20 World Cup Finals 2007","bio":"A swing bowler and a very handy batsman who can fit into a variety of roles, the younger of the Pathan Brothers is a gift to any captain or coach. Primarily considered a lower-order batsman, coaches have even used him at the top of the order and as a pinch-hitter. His rapid rise to the top and his consistent contributions with bat and ball in the early part of his career led to a lot of comparisons. \n\nHe was with Kings XI Punjab during the first three seasons of the IPL and was the team\u2019s leading wicket-taker. The left-arm pacer has since added a few more variations to his armory. He turned out for the Delhi Daredevils in IPL 2012 after the franchise bid USD 1.9 million on him at the IPL Player Auction 2011 and is an important cog in the line-up.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Athlete","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":368214070031410,"offset_x":0,"offset_y":0,"source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xap1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/11149367_368214070031410_613841299669482555_n.png?oh=ab28fd3f234379445c51419c899e0f0e&oe=55B4C88A","id":"368214070031410"},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":2834459,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OfficialIrfanPathan","name":"Irfan Pathan","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"talking_about_count":193836,"username":"OfficialIrfanPathan","were_here_count":0}
