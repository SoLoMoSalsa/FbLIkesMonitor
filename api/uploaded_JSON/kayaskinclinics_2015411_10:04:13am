On furthering this understanding with consumers, a more focused yet still untapped need of having flawless skin that looks good naturally, was identified. The first Kaya Skin Clinic was thus launched with the single-minded objective of delivering flawless skin solutions customized to Indian skin, through the use of the latest technology. \n\nToday, Kaya skin clinic has 82 clinics spread across 26 cities in India, 19 highly successful clinics in the Middle East and 2 clinics in Bangladesh at Dhaka.
