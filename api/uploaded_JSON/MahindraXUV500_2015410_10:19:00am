","can_post":false,"category":"Cars","checkins":0,"company_overview":"Few groups can identify as closely with India's destiny and industrial progress as the Mahindra Group.\n \nThe birth of Mahindra & Mahindra began when K.C. Mahindra visited the United States of America as Chairman of the India Supply Mission. He met Barney Roos, inventor of the rugged 'general purpose vehicle' or Jeep and had a flash of inspiration: wouldn't a vehicle that had proved its invincibility on the battlefields of World War II be ideal for India's rugged terrain and its kutcha rural roads? Swift action followed thought. The Mahindra brothers joined hands with a distinguished gentleman called Ghulam Mohammad. And, on October 2nd, 1945, Mahindra & Mohammad was set up as a franchise for assembling jeeps from Willys, USA. Two years later, India became an independent nation and Mahindra & Mohammad changed its name to Mahindra & Mahindra. \n \nSince then, Mahindra & Mahindra has grown steadily in size and stature and evolved into a Group that occupies a premier position in almost all key sectors of the Indian economy.\n \nThe Automotive Sector has emerged as one of the leading arms of the Mahindra Group. It is in the business of manufacturing and marketing utility vehicles and light commercial vehicles, including three wheelers.\n \nBeing a market leader in utility vehicles in India since inception, Mahindra currently accounts for about half of India's market for utility vehicles. \nOver the years, the Group has developed a large product portfolio catering to a diverse customer base spanning rural and semi-urban customers, defence requirements and luxurious urban utility vehicles. \n","cover":{"cover_id":831728926912673,"offset_x":0,"offset_y":0,"source":"https:\/\/fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-xpf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/11013395_831728926912673_6052025040384135283_n.png?oh=0694faedb8490673b7a57c931f6b2228&oe=55A49CBA&__gda__=1436029959_ea11cb7c4acd97d6efc3f7d98a501b1b","id":"831728926912673"},"description":"Designed and developed entirely in-house by Mahindra, at the world class research and development facility, Mahindra Research Valley, Chennai, the XUV500 is Mahindra's first in a series of next generation global SUVs, with significant inputs in styling and development from customers across the globe.\nAll research & development activities for this global SUV were aligned with global standards of quality, technology, testing norms, regulations & emissions from thevery start.\n \nThe new Mahindra XUV500 is unmatched in terms of style, performance, technology, safety and comfort, providing customers a truly complete driving experience. \n \nLoved by consumers and critics alike, the XUV500 sold out 4 months production in just the first 10 days of launch while in the second round of bookings, the XUV500 received a record 25,000 applications.
