The mind and the body are inextricably connected, and 2.) Nothing has more power to heal and transform the body than the mind.  Freedom from illness depends upon expanding our own awareness, bringing it into balance, and then extending that balance to the body. This process isn\u2019t as complicated as it may sound. \n","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":1006477,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ayurvedahomeremedies","location":{"city":"Noida","country":"India","zip":"201301"},"name":"Ayurveda Home Remedies","parking":{"lot":1,"street":1,"valet":0},"talking_about_count":3053,"username":"ayurvedahomeremedies","website":"http:\/\/www.naturalhealthcareguide.com\/","were_here_count":0}
