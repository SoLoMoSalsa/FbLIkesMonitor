Her foray into the world of badminton was influenced by her father Dr. Harvir Singh, a scientist and her mother Usha Nehwal, both of who were former badminton champions in Haryana.\n\nShe started her badminton training under the guidance of Coach Arif, who was a Dronacharya Awardee.  She currently trains under National Coach and former All England Badminton Champion and Dronacharya Awardee P. Gopichand at his academy in Hyderabad.\n\nIn 2006, Saina surged onto the global scene when she became the first Indian woman to win a 4-star tournament, the Philippines Open. Entering the tournament as the 86th seed, Saina went on to stun several top seeded players on route to the title. The same year also saw Saina finish as runner up at the 2006 BWF World Junior Championships. She did one better in the 2008 by becoming the first Indian to win the World Junior Badminton Championships.\n\nSaina's performance ranks as on par with that of Indian badminton legend Prakash Padukone and her mentor Pullela Gopichand who both won the All England Championship which is of similar status to a Super Series event. Saina's supreme fitness and mental strength are her key assets. Olympic Gold Quest is proud to support the endeavours of Saina in her quest for an Olympic Gold medal.","talking_about_count":1450180,"username":"SainaNehwal.OGQ","website":"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/nehwal-saina; www.ethinos.com","were_here_count":0}
