It is a news channel that has appealed to the Indian masses for its unique style of presentation that is targeted at the common man and not at the elite unlike most news channels. It has been criticized by the print media for its 'in the face reporting' however television viewers have lapped it up and the channel's market share shows the shift in the viewer preference from mundane to loud.\nIn a short period of its existence, India TV has earned a repute of credible reporting, courage, espousal of public interest and its unmatched delivery which is of a great value to all stakeholders. The channel has its bureau and sales representation.","founded":"Rajat Sharma","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":2608154,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/indiatvnews","location":{"city":"Noida","country":"India","latitude":28.57754,"longitude":77.39959,"street":"India TV Broadcast Centre, B30, Sector 85","zip":"201305"},"name":"India TV","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"talking_about_count":700425,"username":"indiatvnews","website":"http:\/\/www.indiatvnews.com","were_here_count":8379}
