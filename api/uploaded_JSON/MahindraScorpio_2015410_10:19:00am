{"id":"68674358000","about":"The Scorpio has always been at the forefront of customer satisfaction with every model continuing to delight consumers and award juries alike with a high-technology offering at an amazing value proposition.","can_post":false,"category":"Cars","checkins":0,"company_overview":"Few groups can identify as closely with India's destiny and industrial progress as the Mahindra Group.\n\nThe birth of Mahindra & Mahindra began when K.C. Mahindra visited the United States of America as Chairman of the India Supply Mission. He met Barney Roos, inventor of the rugged 'general purpose vehicle' or Jeep and had a flash of inspiration: wouldn't a vehicle that had proved its invincibility on the battlefields of World War II be ideal for India's rugged terrain and its kutcha rural roads? Swift action followed thought. The Mahindra brothers joined hands with a distinguished gentleman called Ghulam Mohammad. And, on October 2nd, 1945, Mahindra & Mohammad was set up as a franchise for assembling jeeps from Willys, USA. Two years later, India became an independent nation and Mahindra & Mohammad changed its name to Mahindra & Mahindra. \n\nSince then, Mahindra & Mahindra has grown steadily in size and stature and evolved into a Group that occupies a premier position in almost all key sectors of the Indian economy.\n\nThe Automotive Sector has emerged as one of the leading arms of the Mahindra Group. It is in the business of manufacturing and marketing utility vehicles and light commercial vehicles, including three wheelers.\n\nBeing a market leader in utility vehicles in India since inception, Mahindra currently accounts for about half of India's market for utility vehicles. \nOver the years, the Group has developed a large product portfolio catering to a diverse customer base spanning rural and semi-urban customers, defence requirements and luxurious urban utility vehicles. \nIn 2002, it launched the indigenously engineered world class Sports Utility Vehicle \u2013 Scorpio, which bridges the gap between style and adventure, luxury and ruggedness, and performance and economy.\nScorpio (declared to be the \u2018Car of the Year' by CNBC Autocar, BBC Wheels and Business Standard Motoring) is the Automotive Sector's current flagship vehicle. Mahindra has many more products that have made it popular with individuals and institutions in India and the world.
