IIPM's \"Philosophy\", that can be best described through the article \"Why IIPM's Course is superior to other programs\" written by Dr. Malay Chaudhuri (more about him http:\/\/www.iipm.in\/founder-director-inner\/), Founder Director, IIPM & Author of the Best Seller \u2018The Great Indian Dream' : http:\/\/www.iipm.in\/iipm-philosophy\/","founded":"1973","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":4101819,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/iipmbschool","location":{"city":"New Delhi","country":"India","street":"B-11, Level 5, Qutub Institutional Area, New Delhi-16","zip":"110016"},"mission":"The Roots:\nThe IIPM programme in Planning and Entrepreneurship was conceptualized in 1963 and started in 1973 keeping in mind the unfortunate fact that education in India till then had still remained primarily oriented towards the needs of the private sector and had overlooked the specific requirements of the masses and the public sector. We had even failed to do justice to the private sector in as much as we had not succeeded in impressing upon the students the basic framework within which the private sector had to operate in our country. Then the scope and role of the private sector in our country, in the context of national economic planning, was quite distinct from that of the private sector in the free market economies originally developed through colonial exploitation. \n\nProblems of development of the private and the public sectors were, therefore, needed to be studied and analyzed carefully in the background of national economic planning. Otherwise, we would not be able to translate the laudable goals of plans into physical realities, however sophisticated the planning models may be. \n\nThe Mission:\nThe Indian Institute of Planning and Management had thus set before it the twin tasks: to reorient education and research towards the needs of both the sectors and to establish the link between national economic planning objectives and the development of private enterprises in our country. \n\nThe Philosophy:\n\nIIPM further believes that sustainable growth can only be achieved in the Indian economy when growth strategies cater to the bottom 80% of the population and not just the top 20%. The time has come for India to lead the way in the world and the Indian managers need to develop a strong vision for their companies and help them compete in the world markets while accelerating market growth to make India economically the strongest country in the world. This is the breed of future leaders and managers that IIPM wants to create, those who are aware of the challenges and do not remain intellectually handicapped.\n\nResearch:\nResearch focus of  IIPM is unparalleled not just in India but perhaps globally. IIPM Think tank is IIPM's research arm and Planman Media its publication arm.\n\nThe 'Great Indian Dream Research Center' is IIPM Think Tank's Governance and Policy Unit, and brings out leading publications like the weekly news publication The Sunday Indian (the only news magazine globally in 14 languages), the quarterly journal Great Indian Dream and the bi monthly publications, Governance Watch and Media Watch.\n\nThe Planman Knowledge Center is IIPM Think Tank's Business & Intelligence Unit. It brings out the monthly publications Business & Economy, 4Ps Business & Marketing and The Human Factor; Quarterly publications BFM (the Banking and Finance Quarterly), TN (the Technology Quarterly), Power Women( the Women Leaders quarterly), Count Your Chickens before They Hatch (the Leadership Quarterly), Discover The Diamond In You (the Success Quarterly); and the quarterly journals, Thorns to Competition (the New Age Marketing quarterly), CULT (the Strategy & Entrepreneurship Quarterly and Theory I management (the Case Studies Quarterly)\n\nCSR:\nhttp:\/\/www.gidf.org\/ ; www.thegreatindiandream.org\n\nIIPM's grass-root social action initiative, Aurobindo Chaudhuri Memorial Great Indian Dream Foundation (ACM GIDF) is a developmental and research organisation of national repute, facilitating research and community development initiatives since 2001. Our strategy is to empower the vulnerable sections of the society by building their capacities through education, health and skill\u2013based development. We are working for the cause of human development focusing on the less privileged communities in the rural & urban areas of the country. The spheres of our on ground work and research are governed by issues related to Health, Education, Livelihood, Environment and Justice. \n\nConsulting:\nwww.planmanconsulting.com\nPlanman Consulting, founded in the year 1995 is IIPM's Management Consulting initiative. Planman has built a platform interface to engage the industry and deliver the huge potential value of knowledge, expertise and human resources being developed at IIPM in form of consulting and services. With an economically vibrant India as the back-drop in the late 1990s, the early years of Planman saw itself engaging in assignments involving delivery of advise and its proof in execution and results. In the process the organization has act as working Lab and incubation center for intra-preneurship especially for the faculty and student community of IIPM. This unique symbiotic relationship gives it the advantage of delivering not just advise but an end to end 360 degree capability of executing on ground, whatever it takes to deliver value to its clients and partners.\n\nGlobalization: \nWith changing times IIPM's programme now focusses heavily on International Planning and Sustainable Development. IIPM has been the only B-School globally to have a compulsory Marketing specialization as a part of its programme since 1973 along with additional specializations on Finance, HR etc.. The IIPM programme also has an intensive focus on Entrepreneurship. IIPM today provides the maximum Global Exposure to its students through its compulsory International Immersion programme done in association with leading B-Schools like NYU Stern, Imperial and Cornell University. \n ","name":"IIPM","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"phone":"+91-11-41799992\/3\/4","talking_about_count":25802,"username":"iipmbschool","website":"http:\/\/www.iipm.edu\/","were_here_count":0}
