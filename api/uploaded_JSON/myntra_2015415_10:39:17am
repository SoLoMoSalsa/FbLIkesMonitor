We prefer seeing things (and people) look good, and that includes our Wall. Hence a few forum rules. \n\nNo spam or self promotion - We define spam\/self promotion as 'advertisements' for goods, products, services, websites, offers, promotions, 'click to win a free iPad' scams etc with no related content. Since we aren't aiming for sainthood, competitors' advertisements would also fall under this category. Spam also includes posting the same comment on all the updates on the Wall. We'll request you multiple times to refrain; repeat violation would mean having to ban you. \n\nNo copyright infringement-If you do upload something, please ensure that you have the rights for it. \n\nNo offensive posts- Hateful, racist, sexist, discriminatory, obscene\/vulgar or posting in general violation of the laws of the land, is not likely to have a good reaction. Personal attacks, on Myntra personnel, or fellow users will also fall under this.\n\nNo arguments with  moderators or other users. Ok, we're kidding. We're hoping we never have to argue, but if we ever do, let's remain respectful and considerate to each other, while we're at it.\n\nMost importantly, please do not break the internet by violating anything here https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/terms.php \n\nThe intent of this policy is definitely not to keep your issues\/concerns from being posted. In fact, we would love to hear from you on anything you think might help us serve you better. But let's keep it healthy.\n\nThis page will be jointly handled by our Marketing and Customer Connect functions. \nWe'll share content on fashion \u2013 shows, collections, trends, brand campaigns, both global and Indian. Like every other Brand Page, we'll talk about ourselves too \u2013 our products, our website, our campaigns, our offers, our blog, so that you have the context to give us your feedback and thereby help us improve.\nThough we try to ensure that you always receive the best service from us, sometimes there are rare exceptions. We'll continue to help you resolve the issue, if you ever face one. The account is monitored during business hours on all weekdays. We will acknowledge customer concerns in as close to real time as possible, and start work on resolving the issue. However, since we also have to deal with third party vendors and our own quality adherence systems, our actual Turnaround Time for complete resolution will depend on the nature of the issue. \nIf you'd like to convey your feedback, suggestions or suggest any way in which we can serve you better, do mail us at contact.sm@myntra.com\n","founded":"Feb 2007 ","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":2673626,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/myntra","name":"Myntra","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"phone":"+91-080-43541999","talking_about_count":155054,"username":"myntra","website":"http:\/\/www.myntra.com","were_here_count":0}
