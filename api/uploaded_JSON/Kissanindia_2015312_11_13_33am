Welcome to the World of Kissan!\n\nWe taste good, we look good and we do good.\nFrom the tangy red burst of tomatoes in ketchup, to the gooey sweetness of ripened fruit in jams, we are all about the sensorial delights of nature\u2019s goodies. We perk up a roti, we spruce up a slice of bread, we jazz up a bowl of dahi. We are not about diets, regimens or denial. We are not pureed spinach nor are we a glass of wheatgrass juice.\n\nNurturing three generation of Indians since 1933, Kissan has always played a very vital role in the growth of every child in the nation with food products that are full of natural goodness.It is all about making kids' \u2018growing up\u2019 experience a happy and joyful one. It is also about giving Reassurance to Moms.","founded":"1933","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":574651,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Kissanindia","location":{"city":"Mumbai","country":"India","street":"Write to us at PO Box no 14760","zip":"400099"},"mission":"Our vision is to provide every Indian kid with delicious and nutritious food so that they can eat happily and grow happily.","name":"Kissan","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"phone":"+ 1800-10-22-221","talking_about_count":588,"username":"Kissanindia","were_here_count":0}
