For this reason, the Lifebuoy brand aims to make a difference in peoples\u2019 day-to-day lives by helping to promote health & hygiene, and in particular encourage people to wash their hands with soap. Each year around 3.5 million children under 5 die from diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections, such as pneumonia. Handwashing with soap is the single most cost-effective way to prevent diarrhoeal-related deaths and disease, with the potential to reduce deaths from diarrhoeal diseases by almost half and acute respiratory infections by one quarter.\n\nLifebuoy social mission programmes aim to spread positive hygiene messages through hygiene education activities. The projects we have instigated are already making a difference and helping to save lives. However, it is too big a task for any single organisation to tackle alone, and so the Lifebuoy brand team is partnering with public and private organisations around the world who share its commitment to the cause of health and hygiene.
