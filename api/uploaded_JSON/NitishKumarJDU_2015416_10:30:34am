Widely recognized in political circles as one of select few straight-forward leaders who have delivered with utmost righteousness. As the Chief Minister of Bihar, he gained genuine popularity by infusing accountability in governance and shifting the entire decision-making and public discourse paradigms in the state from being caste-driven to being development-centred.\n\nEarly Life\nNitish Kumar was born to Late Shri Kaviraj Ram Lakhan Singh and Parmeshwari Devi at Hakikatpur (Bakhtiarpur), Patna, Bihar. His father was a known freedom fighter and an acknowledged Ayurveda practitioner. Nitish has a degree in Electrical Engineering from the Bihar College of Engineering, now NIT, Patna. Nitish is a teetotaler, a non-smoker and prefers simple homemade food.\n\nPolitical Career\nParticipated as a devout student leader in the historic J P Movement between 1974 and 1977, and was close to Late Sh Jai Prakash Narayan and Late Sh Karpoori Thakur. This activism also led to his detention under M.I.S.A (Maintenance of Internal Security Act) during the infamous Emergency of 1974-75. Nitish belongs to the select creed of leaders who revel in being intimately conversant with grassroots realities and sensibilities. As a successful and popular administrator, his forte lies in keeping this attribute at the centre of important decision-making.\nPolitical career as an elected people's representative began in 1985 when he was elected to the Bihar Legislative Assembly under the Lok Dal banner. No sooner than 1987, he was, as the President of the State Yuva Lok Dal, leading the young generation in his party.\n\n","can_post":false,"category":"Politician","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":470251259806139,"offset_x":0,"offset_y":0,"source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xat1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/11140159_470251259806139_4630587857966867926_o.jpg","id":"470251259806139"},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Bakhtiyarpur","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":552464,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NitishKumarJDU","location":{"city":"Patna","country":"India","street":"7 Circular Road","zip":"800001"},"name":"Nitish Kumar","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"personal_info":"In 1985, I was elected to the State Assembly.
